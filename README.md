GitHub Dependency Confusion Scanner

This tool automates the discovery of potential dependency confusion vulnerabilities in package.json files across all repositories in a given GitHub organization.

It uses the GitHub CLI (gh), confused, jq, and curl to:
	1.	Enumerate repositories in a GitHub organization.
	2.	Locate all package.json files.
	3.	Fetch the raw package.json from GitHub.
	4.	Run confused to check for packages that do not exist in public registries (potential confusion risk).
	5.	Output results in a clear, tabular format.

	‚Ä¢	Identifies potential dependency confusion risks.
	‚Ä¢	Generates output in an easy-to-read format with repository name, file path, and raw GitHub URL.
